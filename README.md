# jekyllducking-rendermachine
Docker container to render a jekyll site and then to dump it's output to tmp to put the resulting files in a conventional host somewhere

## Note
this is an alternative to using the jekyll webhook

which is a much more robust and continuous solution, this solution here was just an exercise for fun, you’d most certainly be better served just installing jekyll locally and learning it’s build command, or using the above with a CI service
